# Unturned Uconomy Utility Shimmy's Mod

Are you tired of adding each item with commands to the shop?  
Download the UUU and you'll be able to add multiple items directly to your database.

Origonal by: Freenex.
This modded version provides better performance, a dark-themed interface and better ease of use.

## Modded Content Support.
This mod allows the tool to load modded items/vehicles from the remote server. You can enable this functionality by adding the plugin to your server, and enabling 'Detect modded items/vehicles' when connecting.
After installing the plugin, run the command `/UconUtilUpdate` to update the server's modded assets.

## Dark Mode:

This mod supplys a dark interface, rather than the bright white one of the origonal. 

## Better Adding/Editing
Rather than using the controls on the top left, you can now also open the new edit dialogue. This feature makes it easier to add/edit items, as it is less clunky, makes it easier to type in or paste prices, and makes editing faster. Double clicking on entries no longer brings up the wiki page, but now opens the add/edit dialogue. You can still access the wkiki for an entry by right clicking it and pressing the wiki button.
